Place here the logo for your board instead of modifying lib/logo.png!
This way you'll be able to update the board by overwriting all files before worrying about deleting your logo.

Logo filename is logo.png
You can make theme-specific logos that will override the global logo by adding logos named logo_themeName.png

The board looks for *.png, then for *.jpg, then for *.gif

You can also place a custom favicon.gif or .ico in here!
